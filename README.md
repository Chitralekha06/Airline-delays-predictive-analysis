Airline Delays Predictive Analysis

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project aims to analyze and predict airline delays by leveraging a comprehensive dataset provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). The dataset includes on-time performance metrics for domestic flights operated by major U.S. air carriers, offering insights into trends, causes, and potential mitigation strategies for flight delays.

DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The dataset contains detailed information about:

Flight schedules (arrival and departure times)

Delays (arrival, departure, and carrier-related delays)

Cancellations and diversions

Weather conditions

Airports and carriers

KEY FEATURES OF THE DATASET:

Size: 1,247,488 rows and 30 columns

Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

Time Period: Data collection started in June 2003 and is updated monthly as part of the Air Travel Consumer Report.

This dataset is suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to predict delays and identify key factors influencing flight punctuality.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand trends in airline delays.

Identify correlations between different variables such as weather, carriers, and airports.

Predictive Modeling:

Build machine learning models to predict the likelihood and duration of flight delays.

Insights and Recommendations:

Provide actionable insights to airlines and travelers.

Suggest strategies for minimizing delays.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning

XGBoost for advanced predictive modeling

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis

KEY FEATURES:

Detailed visualizations to explore trends and distributions in flight delays.

Predictive models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors causing delays.

RESULTS AND FINDINGS:

EDA Results:

Significant delays observed during winter months due to weather conditions.

Certain airports and carriers have consistently higher delay rates.

Model Performance:

The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy with an F1-score of 0.85.

Feature importance analysis revealed that departure time, weather, and carrier type are the top predictors of delays.

FUTURE WORK:

Integrate live flight data to provide real-time delay predictions.

Extend the analysis to international flights.

Develop a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing delay predictions.
